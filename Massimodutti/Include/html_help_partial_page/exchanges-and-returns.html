        <p id="CambiosDevolucionesInfo1">
            If you wish to return an article purchased through our website, we
            advise that the quickest and easiest way is going to one of our
            stores. The garments must be in perfect condition (not used, not
            washed, with their inside labels still attached and not altered)
            and with their corresponding purchase slip. You cannot exchange or
            return articles of underwear, swimwear, earrings, hosiery or
            socks. Returns at Massimodutti.com are always free and the return
            deadline is 30 days from the date of purchase. Returns must always
            be made in the same country where the purchase was made. <br> <br>
            <span style="text-decoration: underline">STORE RETURN</span> <br>
            To make an in-store return, you must go to the store with the
            garment you wish to return, along with the purchase slip or
            invoice. Once you are in the store, the person in charge will make
            the return and give you a return confirmation document on the
            spot. We recommend that you keep this document. <br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline">HOME RETURN*</span> <br>
            You can request a return from home through the website. After
            verifying all the details, we will send a messenger to collect
            your package. To specify the collection details, the carrier will
            contact you by e-mail. If for any reason the collection is not
            convenient for you, contact the Costumer Service by calling
            900 456 000. The steps to follow for the return are shown below: <br>
            <br> 1- Find the slip we have sent you with the order and mark
            the articles to be returned on it. <br> <br> 2- As shown in
            the illustration we sent with your order, pack the article(s) in
            the original box and close it with the red security sticker(s) we
            sent with your order. <br> <br> 3-Request the return through
            the My account section of our website. <br> <br> 4-Deliver
            the closed box to the messenger at the address you have indicated
            to us. <br> <br> 5-In the next few days, you will receive
            the amount of the return via the payment method used for purchase.
            <br> <i>*Only if you realize the delivery at home address.</i>

        <p class="preg">When will I receive the amount of my return?</p>
        <p id="CambiosDevolucionesInfo2">
            Once we have approved the return and your bank has processed it
            (the estimated time varies according to the banking institution),
            you will receive a confirmation e-mail indicating that in a few
            days you will receive the corresponding amount in your account.
            What should I do if the amount of my return is incorrect? If the
            amount of your return is incorrect, contact our Customer Services
            Department by calling 900 456 000 or via the e-mail address <a style="float: none !important;" href="mailto:contact@massimodutti.com">contact@massimodutti.com</a>.
            We will solve the problem as soon as possible. Please remember
            that Massimodutti.com reserves the right to reject returns
            communicated or sent outside the set period, or garments which are
            not in the same condition as when they were received.

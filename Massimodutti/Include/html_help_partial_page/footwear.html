        <p class="preg">Can I obtain a catalogue of the footwear models?</p>
        <p id="contenidoCalzadoInfo">
            No, it is not possible to have a catalogue that shows which footwear
            models are available on the website at all times, since we introduce
            new footwear models in the online store every week. To this effect,
            we recommend that you visit our online store or contact our Customer
            Services Department, who will answer your questions about stock
            availability of a specific footwear model, by calling 900 456 000 or
            by sending an e-mail to <a style="float: none !important;" href="mailto:contact@massimodutti.com">contact@massimodutti.com</a>

            produced following hand-crafted processes (brushing, waxing,
            greasing, ageing, etc.), which could produce minimal differences of
            finish.

            The aim of our product policy is not to involve risks to
            users' health. To this effect, we rigorously comply with our
            internal standard with regard to product health: Clear to Wear, which
            our suppliers are obliged to meet. In this way, we aim to guarantee
            that the products manufactured do not contain substances which, in
            certain concentrations, could be harmful to people's health. We
            check the fulfilment of this health standard using two monitoring
            processes: a prior one, in which the supplier is informed of the
            obligatory nature and implications of said standard, and in which
            they promise to exhaustively analyse their raw materials; and another
            subsequent one, through which we certify that the raw materials used
            in the manufacture of our products really meet this standard.

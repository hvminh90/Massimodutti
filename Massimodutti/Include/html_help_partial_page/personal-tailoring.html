                    Our online shop currently does not offer a Personal Tayloring suit
                    and/or shirt customization service. If you want a customised
                    Personal Tailoring suit or shirt, please visit any of our shops
                    that offer this service. We will be happy to help you. <br> <br>
                    What our online shop can offer is a selection of suits and shirts,
                    previously made with the strict manufacturing criteria of Personal
                    Tailoring; these include the quality of the fabric or the
                    unbeatable finishes of the garment.

                    Is the quality used in Personal Tailoring
                    different from the other suits and shirts?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yes. The selection of "super" quality fabrics such as the
                    "120/2 double yarn" of the cotton used in shirts and the so-called
                    "super wool 130’s" in tailoring give Personal Tailoring garments
                    premium quality, softness and comfort.

                <p>
                    Yes. Currently, all Personal Tailoring trousers are Slim Fit,
                    giving them a better, more stylish fit and increased quality.

                <p>
                    No, each Personal Tailoring shirt is made based on a pattern
                    and models. The product description shows whether it is a Slim Fit
                    shirt, or a Tailored Fit shirt.

        <p class="preg">How can I start my watch working?</p>
        <p>
            To start your watch you must remove the plastic piece found on its
            crown. <br> <br> <img title="Watches" alt="Watches" src="http://static.massimodutti.net/3/static2/marketingSpots/MoreInfo/GuiaDeCompra/31_07_2012/img/watches.jpg">

        <p class="preg">Are Massimo Dutti watches water resistant?</p>
        <p>
            You must pay attention to the degree of impermeability of each model.
            The impermeability is shown at the back of each watch (for example,
            "50M WATER RESISTANT"). In general, they are not watches expressly
            produced for practising water sports, so we recommend certain
            restrictions to their use. Water resistance is normally expressed in
            metres or atmospheres. 50M (metres) is equivalent to 5 ATM
            (atmospheres of pressure). This does not mean that the watch can be
            submerged down to 50 metres below the surface of the water, rather
            that it can be used in aquatic activities (swimming, etc.) without
            being submerged to a great depth. In any case, the wear to the
            leather strap may be greater the longer the watch is exposed to
            water. <br> <br> <i>
                There is international terminology to
                identify the water resistance of watches
            </i>: <br> <b>
                Water
                resistant
            </b> - may resist splashing (hand washing, rain, etc.). <br>
            <b>30 M (or 3 ATM)</b> - may get wet (shower, etc.), but not be
            submerged in water for prolonged periods. <br> <b>
                50 M (or 5
                ATM)
            </b> - may be used in aquatic activities (swimming, etc.) but not
            for snorkelling (immersion without oxygen tanks) or diving.

            What guarantee period do Massimo Dutti watches
            have?
        </p>
        <p>
            All our watches are guaranteed for a period of 2 years from the
            purchase date. This guarantee is limited, meaning that there are
            certain components not covered by it. For this purpose, we recommend
            that you carefully read the guarantee leaflet supplied with each
            watch.

    <div class="faq">
        <p class="preg">What can I do if my watch is faulty?</p>
        <p>
            A faulty watch can be taken to the store of your choice. The
            repair period will be a maximum of 30 days from reception of the
            faulty watch in the corresponding store. Please remember that for the
            guarantee to be valid, it is essential that the guarantee leaflet is
            presented, duly completed and stamped, together with the faulty watch
            (or where appropriate, a copy of the invoice or corresponding
            purchase slip).

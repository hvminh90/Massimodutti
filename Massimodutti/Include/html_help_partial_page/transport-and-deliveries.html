            You can check the status of your order at any time by accessing the
            "Orders placed" section of your account. If you placed your
            order using the Guest option, you can track your order via the link
            provided in the confirmation e-mail we sent you. For any query
            regarding the delivery, do not hesitate to contact our Customer
            Service Department by calling 900 456 000 or by using the e-mail
            address <a style="float: none !important;" href="mailto:contact@massimodutti.com">contact@massimodutti.com</a>.
            If you have chosen in-store delivery, we will inform you of the
            arrival of your order by means of an SMS, and you will have 15 days
            to collect it. To do this, you must present the corresponding order
            number and an ID card (which may be of the purchaser or another
            person of their choosing). If you have chosen home delivery, at the
            time when your order leaves our warehouse, you will receive an e-mail
            confirming that it has been sent with a tracking number and the link
            to the carrier's website. Once the carrier has received your
            order, it will contact you 24 hours previously by SMS to specify the
            delivery date and address, as well as to inform you of the
            possibility of modifying the delivery.
